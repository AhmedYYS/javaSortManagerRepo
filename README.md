# javaSortManagerRepo

Welcome to the Sort Manager

In this program we use 3 different Algorithms -
- Binary Sorter
- Insertion Sorter
- Bubble Sort

You are encouraged to press a number other than 9 and enter to start the program

Once the program has begun you are presented with another question to choose between the 3 algorithms.

After choosing you are then asked another question to choose an array size.

Once choosing an array size you are then presented with both the unsorted version of the array which was generated for you and also given the sorted version using the chosen algorithm.

The program then presents you with the speed in which the array was sorted, you can compare the times by running the program again in the same space of the console.

In this program I've also tested the performance of the all the algorithms with given array sizes, different array sizes also to compare speeds.

I've individually tested the sorters.

Created 3 exceptions that are thrown in certain situations, also testing these exceptions.

Lastly adding logs inside my code in various different places, also showing up on the console with date and time.
